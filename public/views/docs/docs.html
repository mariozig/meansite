			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<h3>How It works</h3>	
			<ol>
				<li>The Browser connects to the desired url which is in the form of http:/localhost:3000 (if you're in a development environment) or the site name.<br/> The Connection is handled by Express which uses the <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/consolidate.js/">consolidate.js library</a> to render the server side application markup (the default templating engine is <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">swig</a>).
				</li>
				<li>Page is returned to browser - The page rendered contains the inclusion of the angular.js library(among others).
				The markup contains an "ng-view" tag which is where the angular app initializes.
				</li>

			<h3>Installation</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="installation"></div>
			<p class="alert alert-danger">Make sure mongodb is installed and running on port 27017 before you start</p>
			<p>To startup with MEAN follow the next step:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Use git to clone the repository</li><pre><code>git clone http://github.com/linnovate/mean.git</code></pre>
				<li>Enter the subdirectory that was created: <pre><code>cd mean</code></pre></li>
				<li>Install MEAN.IO's dependencies by running:<pre><code> npm install</code></pre></li>
				<li>To launch mean run: <pre><code>grunt</code></pre></li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			Standing on the Shoulders of giants....

			<h3>NPM</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="npm"></div>
			<p>npm is the official package manager for Node.js. As of Node.js version 0.6.3, npm is bundled and installed automatically with the environment. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. It also allows users to install Node.js applications that are available on the npm registry.</p>

			<h3>Bower</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="bower"></div>
			<p>Bower is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.
			Bower runs over Git, and is package-agnostic. A packaged component can be made up of any type of asset, and use any type of transport (e.g., AMD, CommonJS, etc.).</p>

			<h3>Grunt</h3>
			<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="grunt"></div>
			<p>Grunt is a great tool for automating your JavaScript tasks. The ecosystem is huge, containing many common tasks you can use in your daily development process.
			To configure grunt you start with the gruntfile.js file, where you define the tasks you want to run. 
			We start with two basic tasks:
			</p>
			

<h4>Default</h4>
<p>The default task is the task that runs when you type 'grunt' in your command-line, the default task consists of three sub-tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>JSHint:</strong> The linter task that keep your JavaScript code free of common mistakes and syntax errors.</li>
	<li><strong>Watch:</strong> This watches your file system for changes and automatically reloads the application whenever you change certain files.</li>
	<li><strong>Nodemon:</strong> This runs your Node.js application using nodemon.
		Please notice that the last two tasks are wrapped with another task called Concurrent to keep the application continuously running.
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Test</h4>
<p>This task runs when you type 'grunt test' in your command-line, the test task consists of three sub-tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>env:test :</strong> This is a simple task that changes the NODE_ENV global environment variable to 'test'.</li>

<li><strong>mochaTest:</strong> This runs the mocha server tests that are located in the app/tests folder.
</li>
<li><strong>karma:unit</strong></li> This uses the karma test runner to run the AngularJS unit tests.
</ol>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="inner-link-anchor" id="faq"></div>
<ol>
<li><h3>"Error: failed to connect to [localhost:27017]"</h3>

MongDB isn't running, please run it before you run grunt...
Consider MongoDB a program that needs to be running before you can run grunt on your MEAN project.
Follow these instructions here for mongodb installation:
http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/ Manual Installation is the only manner I could get things working

I also needed to be in /usr/local/bin before I could fire mongod Once mongod is running in your terminal window, open a different terminal window and cd to the directory where your MEAN project is located.

There you can run a grunt command and avoid the dreaded warning: [nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

At that point, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000
</li>

<li><h3>"I run grunt but see a white screen with nothing in it"</h3>
Either you havn't run npm install or it in turn did not trigger bower install
</li>
<li><h3>"I run grunt as documented but get a command line not found"</h3>
Install grunt-cli globally - npm install grunt-cli -g
</li>
<li><h3>"I get Error: EMFILE, too many open files‚Äù in npm install."</h3>
See http://otaqui.com/blog/1618/how-to-fix-error-emfile-too-many-open-files-from-yeoman-and-npm/
or - set your ulimit higher if your using a mac ulimit -n 1024
